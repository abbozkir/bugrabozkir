    "need": "The challenge was to effectively display a 3-dimensional dataset on a chart while allowing for point selection and highlighting. Unfortunately, the chosen charting component (Chart.js) lacked support for customizing individual points, which was crucial for maintaining consistent styles within datasets and adding extra layers of information to the points. Also, there was a requirement to distinctly highlight selected points. Additionally, the data structure received from the server posed a challenge as it differed slightly from the format accepted by the charting component.",
    "solution": "To address these issues, an innovative solution was devised. Each unique data value was associated with a separate dataset, and then an axis conversion technique was employed. This approach ensured that each numeric entry you observe on the chart corresponds to an individual dataset, yet still accurately appears at its designated x-y coordinate. This mapping allowed the simultaneous visualization of all three pieces of information. Moreover, the solution introduced an extra dataset dedicated to highlighting. This specialized dataset features a solitary point that dynamically moves across the chart, effectively highlighting the selected point of interest. Check the source code and observe the careful handling of data manipulation and state management, working to align the non-standard data structure and reveal valuable insights on the chart.",
    "usage": "Experience satellite selection either directly from the chart or through the provided list. Witness the synchronization between the chart and list components. Notice how the chosen satellite is highlighted. Delve into the details presented below, encompassing information concerning the satellite, tower, and signal quality attributes."

  "WeatherChart": {
    "need": "The challenge here lay in enabling the addition of comments to the chart, where each comment corresponds to a specific point, accompanied by a subtle text balloon. This introduced the need to navigate through complex data manipulation, ensuring that the comments aligned with the data points. Moreover, handling individual point styling posed an additional challenge, similar to the challenge faced in the Signal Chart.",
    "solution": "To address these challenges, the previously employed solution was extended, involving the addition of an extra dataset. However, this weather chart presented a distinct use case, with multiple points now within this dataset. To manage instances where multiple points coincided on the same x-axis position, the dataset was treated as a scatter dataset. Additionally, comments reside within a point for all four datasets, requiring complex data manipulation. For a deeper observation, please review the source code.",
    "usage": "Click on a point with the balloon to view or remove an existing comment, or click on a blank point to add a comment."

  "DevelopmentPlanning": {
    "need": "The requirement here is for a planning tool that accommodates a variety of jobs from different parent sources. These jobs need the flexibility to be combined, ensuring the precise ordering of tasks is maintained. Additionally, a critical aspect is the correlation between the multiselect feature and the associated data table. When a job is deselected, it should vanish from the table. Conversely, if a job is removed from the table, it should be automatically deselected.",
    "solution": "The solution addresses these challenges through careful state management. A pivotal component of the solution is the incorporation of custom body templates for the data table, enhancing visual clarity and interaction. Combined jobs are thoughtfully presented with distinct CSS styles. For a closer look at the intricacies of complex state management and custom styling, please refer to the source code.",
    "usage": "Start by selecting a team and a few tickets. Feel free to expand your selection to multiple teams, each with different tickets. Combine tickets by selecting checkboxes for each team, stacking tickets on top of each other. Experiment by adjusting the estimated time, and observe how the calculations adapt. Explore the correlation by temporarily removing a few tickets to observe the impact; then, re-add those tickets to witness how the order changes. When you're ready, hit the 'Add' button to witness the visualization of combined tickets and the automatic calculation of the minimum estimated time for the cluster. Notably, if there are combined tickets, the minimum time within that cluster is determined by the highest estimated time among its member tickets. Each cluster's value is then included in the overall result, providing you with a comprehensive picture."

  "GamePlanning": {
    "need": "The dynamic requirement involves the ability to add data rows multiple times, ensuring that values within these rows are editable. Additionally, users should be able to add rows from the rows they've previously created, fostering reusability, and remove existing rows as needed.",
    "solution": "To address these needs, a child component was designed to represent individual rows. A carefully executed callback function handles value changes with precision. When users add a row from a previously created row, it replaces the last row if it's empty; otherwise, it's added as a new row. Additionally, a custom combobox body is designed to visualize color selection, offering a choice between predefined colors and custom colors. Once the user saves the list, the rows are added to the previously added list. During the 'play' action, rows with blank values are ignored. The final result is displayed with custom CSS styling, offering a polished presentation. Please check the source code to see both parent and child components and the relation between them.",
    "usage": "To start, add a new row, which represents a team in this scenario, by clicking the 'Add New Team' button. Feel free to edit the attributes as needed. You can select a color from the available options or assign a custom one. Also, select teams from the list of previously created teams. Once your teams are prepared, you can press the 'Play' button to observe the teams you've added. If you're interested in reusing newly added teams, check the previous teams list."
